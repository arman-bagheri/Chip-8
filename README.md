Chip 8, was an attempt to virtualize and homogenize old console game development, which back in the day, was very hardware dependent and console specific. this project is an attempt to emulate 
the chip8 specifications in the C language using the sdl library for the graphics and inputs, skipping the sound, which is only a beep. there are also a lot of acoompanying test roms that i've tested
the emulator with.
